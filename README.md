# Simple Chat microservice

### Chat microservice based on node.js and express, with websockets.

### Message persistence in database.

### Includes an ultra-lightweight JS interface.

#### [This backend works with the Socket.io dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io). Which is written in TypeScript.
